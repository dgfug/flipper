The Network plugin provides the Network Inspector, which is used to inspect outgoing network traffic in your apps. You can easily browse all requests being made and their responses. The plugin also supports gzipped responses.

All requests sent from the device are listed in the plugin. Clicking on a request shows details such as headers and body. You can filter the table for domain, method or status by clicking on the corresponding value in the table.

The following screenshot shows the Network Inspector in action.
