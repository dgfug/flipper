# headless-tic-tac-toe

**Experimental feature!**

Flipper can run plugins in a headless mode - expose their API over the wire. This is an example of how it might look like.

## Quick start

0. Clone [Flipper repo](https://github.com/facebook/flipper)
0. Navigate to `/desktop` folder.
0. Run `yarn`
0. Run `yarn flipper-server`
0. Start you mobile device (or any other device that supports Flipper).
0. Open your app that supports "ReactNativeTicTacToe" plugin (for instance, [React Native Example app](https://github.com/facebook/flipper/tree/main/react-native/ReactNativeFlipperExample)).
0. In a different terminal window, navigate to `/desktop/examples/headless-demo`
0. Run `yarn`
0. Run `yarn start`
